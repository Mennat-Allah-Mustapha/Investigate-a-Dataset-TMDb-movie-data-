# Investigate-a-Dataset-TMDb-movie-data-
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue

## Trying to answer these questions: 
* How is the production volume changed through years?
* What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?

> through this data we can see that production has gave the movie industry much more inerest and budget with the begining of the new millennium. that decreased in the following five years but still more than 1900's in general

> So apperently the movie production got more popular through years and the overall revenue increased

> Movies with more than 2.30 hours run time haven't got alot of watching although some of them got higher revenue but defently not those are more than 3 hours run time
